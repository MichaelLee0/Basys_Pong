# Basys_Pong Project

## Objective
Get a SystemVerilog working version of Pong working on a Basys3 using two joysticks (or buttons - we can build to that) as controllers and displaying game information on an LCD Screen.

## Plan
* Stage 1: Be able to print out to the LCD screen and control the position of it 
* Stage 2: Program Game behavior with simple controls (Possibly using on board buttons to reduce complexity)
* Stage 3: Integrate functionality with joysticks
